*--------Formatting ns2 dataset----------*

use ~/ns2.dta //adjust as necessary

sample 50, count

drop ParticipantID
keep Age Sex date zipcode lone fne

bys zipcode: egen m_lone_zip=mean(lone)
*this step created a new variable (m_lone_zip) which represents the mean loneliness score for each zipcode*

bys zipcode: egen m_fne_zip=mean(fne)
*this step created a new variable (m_fne_zip) which represents the mean social anxiety score for each zipcode*

save ns2_2, replace

collapse m_lone_zip m_fne_zip, by (zipcode)
save ns2_3, replace
*ns2_3 is now ready to merge*

*--------Formatting urban/rural pop. dataset----------*

clear
insheet using "https://docs.google.com/uc?id=1Z-uwRD_9Qmnl9EPfWaOlX97j4tG8L1NP&export=download"

rename v2 zipcode
rename v4 tot_pop
rename v5 urb_pop
rename v8 rur_pop

drop v1 v3 v6 v7 v9
*dropping unnecessary data*

drop in 1
drop in 1
*used this twice to drop first 2 rows of observations that were unnecessary column titles*

destring zipcode, replace
destring urb_pop, replace
destring rur_pop, replace
destring tot_pop, replace

save urban_pop, replace
clear
*urban_pop is now ready to merge*

*------------Merging datasets---------------*

use ns2_3, clear

merge 1:m zipcode using urban_pop

edit //visual check looks good, now need to check merge variable

tab _m //looks good, all zipcodes in sample from ns2_3 were matched to urban_pop dataset

drop if _m<3 & _m>1 //this deletes all unnecessary data for zipcodes that do not have data in the ns2_3 dataset

*final visual check*
edit
sum
*looks good*

save ns2urb, replace
