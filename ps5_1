//Version 16

/*This project uses data collected from undergraduate psychology students regarding their social health/social functioning (e.g. loneliness, social anxiety, and attachment style), and will attempt to merge this data with location-based data to look at community/county-level factors that may influence these aspects of personal social health and social functioning. Specifically, I am interested in studying whether community- or county-level factors of poverty, urbanity, and obesity might have an impact on individual levels of loneliness, social anxiety, and attachment style. I expect that these individual factors will be influenced by community- and/or county-level factors due to their social nature and the tendency for individuals to engage in social comparison. To examine this potential relationship, I will be merging datasets from a variety of sources that provide information specifically relevant to these variables (poverty, urbanity, and obesity). I will also merge a dataset containing weather information specific to when the assessment of social health/functioning was captured and include this in my analyses, so as to reduce the chance of weather acting as a confounding variable. My ultimate goal is to use this merged dataset to provide 
a comprehensive analysis of community- and county-level impact on individual social health and social functioning. These analyses will be primarily exploratory, however I expect that urbanity will have the most predominant effect on social health within my collected sample.*/
