We spent a lot of time talking about life and our family, and it was really nice to catch up. We talked a lot about our mother, who has recently been diagnosed with a degenerative vision disease. We talked about what may happen and how we should prepare for the road ahead with her, and she reassured me that I can still move along with all of my life plans as my mother will have plenty of people around to take care of her. It did get me thinking a lot about the situation and how it makes me feel. I worry about my father having to take care of her as well as his health to begin with, as he isn't exactly the perfect picture of health. This leaves a lot on my shoulders and I think that it's going to be a really tough time for all of us to get through. I wish to move farther away, but I'm wondering if i'll still be able to do that.

I didn't think of the consequences that could possibly happen and i just didn't realize many things that could follow up my decisions, but at that moment it was just fun. I guess it was the act of doing something ""bad"" that was exciting because prior to my junior year i was always a good student (went to all my classes, etc..).

Me and my mom usually run around for months getting everything he ask for. Most of the time when one birthday ends he knows what he wants to do the next year for his birthday. this year he decided it would be black panther themed. So he needed the outfit and the accessories and then we had to watch the movie. when he came home and saw everything the look on his face was priceless. It made me feel really good because I had taken care of him all his life. My mom is disabled so she really needed help and I was there. I saw him being born and now he is almost a teenager. I felt accomplished. Also I felt really old and like time was just going by really fast. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.033,130.232,132.372,40,Disagree,Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Disagree,Disagree Strongly,Disagree Strongly,Disagree Strongly,Agree,Agree Strongly,Disagree Strongly,Disagree Strongly,Disagree Strongly,Disagree Strongly,Agree Strongly,Agree,13.463,47.298,50.015,6,3,6,6,5,4,"Cannot do at all

She did not mind that, she did not even notice it, which I found funny and reassuring. She and I went to eat dinner a few blocks away from my school, and it was very enjoyable. We had an endless conversation that covered multiple subjects. After dinner, we went directly to the Gordon Theater at my school to watch Frankenstein. I was a little weary of inviting her to the play with me, because she used to work in the theater at the school that she works at, so she always feels the need to make unnecessary comments about any play she sees anywhere else. She only made one comment, which was very surprising. She and I both enjoyed the play very much. It exceeded our expectations, which neither of us could stop saying. I was happy that she did not make lots of comments, because they are always very disconcerting. After the play, we went back to my room and spoke about how much we enjoyed the show. Then we got ready for bed (she spent the night because the play ended too late - she wouldn't have been able to make the drive home). We watched some of the show New Amsterdam, which she fell asleep to while watching. It was really nice to have her there. It makes me very thankful that I am fortunate enough to make memories with my grandma like that.

I take the train almost every week day and because I still don't have a card, I have to buy a ticket every time I go. When I take the ticket out of the slot I tend to grab it in the same quick motion every single time, it's funny to reflect on. In the moment I think it's cool but in retrospect I think I look stupid. Getting on the train feels so unsanitary, I try not to touch the bars unless it's absolutely necessary. I'm not a germaphobe, I just like feeling as clean as I can be. I try to find a good window seat because I like looking at nature even though the ride to my usual destination is not that scenic. I try to stay off my phone. I like to give my mind time to think about whatever it needs to before it becomes occupied again. I also make sure to pay attention to the stops being announced because I missed my stop once before.

I go to work so that I can pay my bills and set aside an extra chunk of money each week in order to pay off the principal on my loans.

The soccer season had been very grueling at this point, logging 90 minutes in the past three matches for the mens soccer program here at Rutgers Camden.  It was the first day back to training and the weather outside made me chill all the way to the bone, truly adding another adverse element to the training session.  After the two hour practice had concluded, I took the nicest hot shower of the year thus far and knew there was only thing I could do once I was back in my room.  Of course this was FIFA 19 and the FIFA franchise has always been my favorite of all video games.  Combining my favorite pastime and the ability to talk to my hometown friends who attend college scattered across the country had proven once more to be very helpful when attempting to relax in a stressful point in the school year.

I can still remember looking out the car window as I hold my on the drive home around midnight as my father would tell me to look at the sky for Santa Claus. I felt so much excitement to get home and spread my homemade reindeer food out for Santa's sleigh. I feel warmth from this memory because of how fascinated I was with the Christmas season during my adolescent years. To this day, I feel a similar excitement to Christmas with my family.

It took all four years of my softball career to get it done but I eventually achieved my life long goal. Softball is a very hard sport so achieving 100 hits in my small town was a very big thing. According to the record books, I am technically the first person in my high schools history to reach 100, which to me is amazing. The best thing about this day that makes me happy and warm is that I was not expecting it to happen. I had no clue that I was even close to 100 hits which made the moment even more special. My whole team stopped the game and rush to me on first base giving me high fives and hugs. They brought out balloons and posters and flowers. It was just a crazy awesome day.

I remember my cat waking me up that morning by screaming in my face, so the first thing i did was kick her out. I went back to sleep and then i was woken up again by my mom who had some small gifts to give me since she couldn't wait.  We then went to the movies which was great, and pretty much spent the rest of the day gorging ourselves with all the free things we could get from friendly's, ihop, etc. November second is also my mom's birthday so we tend to do a lot together.

I didn't know what to do one part of me was saying quit don't do it but the other was saying you love to dance and you should keep doing what you love. so I made the decision of staying on the team.,10.08,82.157,87.429,22,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Disagree,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Agree,Agree,6.566,31.266,32.862,6,9,9,9,5,7,6,8.53,39.573,40.801,4,moderately agree5,moderately agree5,slightly agree4,moderately agree5,yuridia,22.354,33.01,34.321,3,strongly agree,strongly agree,strongly agree,18.371,24.532,26.125,2,2,4,14.154,17.714,20.385,2,5,2,12.02,14.131,16.849,2,"very concerned

The smell of coffee and sweet bread would fill up the kitchen. The technology was not very big in Mexico and communication was always key.

My ex boyfriend and I were still together and we were at his house. It was late night time and we were in his room watching movies. It was summer time and hot in the house. His dad had recently moved out so the house was his own and his brothers.  I spent almost every day there. We were young and since his parents didnt live there anymore we had complete freedom so going to his house was like an escape from reality. i felt like a grown up. His brother has passed away now but at this time he was still alive and my boyfriend and I's relationship was good. Since theyre not in my life anymore this might be why I think back on these memories and long for them.

This day always makes me nostalgic because she is a huge member of our family and we all love her unconditionally. My family and I were at a bike store looking for bikes for our family, and after about two hours of having no luck finding any bikes we left the store. Right next door to the bike store, was a set store. My parents were completely against going into the pet store because they no intentions of buying a pet, but they eventually gave in. After we entered the store, we noticed a glass kennel filled will a litter of fluffy puppies. I immediately went over and put my hand over the side to pet the puppies. I remember feeling a swarm of fluff on my hands, but one puppy stood out because it kept licking my hand.

So, my cousin and I invited my grandmother to come to breakfast with us. When we went, the three of us talked and laughed. I can tell my cousin and my grandmother anything. They are both easy to talk to, and I consider my cousin to be one of my best friends.

I usually fight myself while I'm getting up because sometimes it's hard to pull myself out of bed. Something very odd about waking up so early for school is that even though I feel so tired, I also feel very productive. Getting up early in the morning is calming in a way. No one else is awake in the apartment. It's just me getting ready for the day in the peaceful quiet. My mom drives me to the train station and I pay the dollar and change for my ticket and board the train with my good friend. We talk the whole way to school. Usually about school work, sleep (lack of), family, friends, life, and food occasionally. Our eight o'clock class lasts over an hour and a half. I love Psychology. I have more friends in that class that enjoy it as well. Psychology is what I want to invest my time and effort in later on in the future. Getting my masters and possibly my PhD means a lot to me. That is what pulls me out of my bed at six in the morning and makes me stay awake in that class- most of the time. I close my eyes for a second some days when it's all too much. After all my classes end and after I stress for a few minutes in-between, I walk to my boyfriend's house and we eat, talk, laugh, joke, kiss, wrestle, watch tv, and cuddle. He is my best friend and he gets on my nerves constantly and vise versa, but that's just how we work. I love that kid. After the day is close to ending and we say goodbye so he can go to work or my mom picks me up after she leaves work, I feel relieved. Getting through another day is simply how I live life. One day is an individual success and I love to end it with love. Getting home and being with my family and watching movies and tv shows is what we do. I love it. It makes me feel close to them. Sometimes we annoy each other but that's what family does. We love each other too much to let those little insignificant times, ruin the unity. That is usually an ordinary day for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,635.528,882.525,883.234,24,Agree Strongly,Agree Strongly,Agree Strongly,Agree Strongly,Agree,Agree Strongly,Agree,Agree Strongly,Agree Strongly,Agree,Agree Strongly,Agree,Agree,Agree Strongly,Disagree Strongly,Disagree Strongly,Agree Strongly,Agree Strongly,Agree Strongly,Agree Strongly,14.288,54.228,57.212,6,"Highly certain can do

They gave me anxiety and I never wanted to be alone with them. Since rescuing Snoopy and being open to letting this cat love me and love it back it broke down a wall of fear for me. Now when I lay in bed I am comfortable with letting the cat sit on my chest while I pet him. It was new and different for me because I am only used to really liking dogs instead of cats. It is possible that I only like my cat this much but it is nice to not have anxiety around my cat.

The restaurant ended up being crazy packed and there wasn't any parking for us. I remember him saying "" Oh if someone was ready earlier we probably would've been eating earlier"" and I'm thinking about how its so common for people to go out to breakfast on Sundays. We ended up driving to a diner that wasn't too far away but still was pretty busy. It was the first time we've been there together even though we have both gone separately times before. The diner was pretty packed but there was barely a wait and the atmosphere was pretty cozy. I remember him talking about all the old times him and his friends used to go get food at 3am here and always order their apple pie with ice cream and how things aren't the same anymore. We were talked about how quickly time flies and how things are always changing. It was nice talking and being in the moment.

I was invited to a party at Temple by one of my childhood friends. I ended up inviting all my new college friends to come along. When we get their we are excited because we see all these beautiful people outside of the house and its our first year real college party during our first semester at school. We get to skip the line and get in for free because I see my friend at the entrance. We say hi and he tells me to go out back to get a drink. I run into more of my friends and they give my new college friends a drink. We start dancing and singing with the crowd already there. We eventually run into more of my college friends and we start dancing with them. As the party goes along we move around the house. Eventually we get to my friend's room to cool off. We start hanging out with him and his friends. Eventually we go back into the party and I started dancing with some really cute boys who actually knew how to dance. I did not want the night to end.

I lost him due to gun violence in the neighborhood which he lived in. This had to be the hardest thing I've been through this year almost in my life. I grew up with this boy, and for him to be here one day and gone the next was hard for me. I was feeling very down for a straight week at one point, I didn't really want to talk to anyone and I started isolating myself a lot. As the weeks have been moving on I find myself getting very sad and breaking down, just crying when I think about my cousin. Being around my family made things easier , just knowing someone who was going through my pain made me feel less lonely.

This week a couple of my friends came home as well as her, and we all agree that they were going to come to my house so we can catch up. It seemed like she was not going to show up so we all decided to call her, but she never answered to any of our calls. I had issues with her before about the lack of communication last year and she knew how much it bothered me when someone did not answer. I was not mad at the fact that she never showed up since she had done that before; at this point it was normal that she did not follow through with plans. Even though I know I can count on her if I actually needed her, it still made me upset that she did not even warn us that she was not going to make it. It made me feel like she did not care to see us and did not bother to tell us. As mentioned before, I know I can count on her is a problem arises, but it makes me think that I cannot count on her to experience the good things and have fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,33.471,491.637,492.942,54,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree Strongly,Agree,Agree,Agree Strongly,Agree Strongly,2.439,31.12,32.394,12,"Highly certain can do

He hit me with the ""wanna FaceTime?"" I had a smile on my face as I responded and told him ""sure"". He gave me his number and I got comfortable and laid on my back as I stared at the ceiling preparing to call him. On the this ring he answered, it was silent for about 5 seconds and then he said ""hey"". His voice was so sweet sounding and calming. We exploded into amazing conversion about nothing. We spoke about whatever came to our minds. We laughed. A lot. His laugh was the most adorable thing one heard in while. I told him that. He complimented me back. After laughs, conversations about honey mustard, and flirting we decided to call it a night because we both had to wake up early. He said goodnight and so did I then I went to sleep.

This event is something that I can depend on every week, we are always consist in going there. I relate my time at my grandmother with happiness and laughter. I thought of this event because it is one of the most consistent things in my life. Every week is a little different, but in my life it is very ordinary and something that I grew up doing and something that my family will continue to do. This week was a bit different because my brother wasn't there. Without him being there there was an absence of some laughter, and less talk about politics(something I prefer not to talk about). I remember my four year old niece who lights up the entire room, and has way to much energy.

It was really nice to sit down all together after a while. It made me remember when we were all young in grade school and my sister was so little. I remember feeding her when she was really young. Yes, the three of us used to fight a lot, but we had a lot of fun together when we were young. It made me think, how did we get this old already. I still cannot believe how old my sister is I feel like she is still five years old. I am the oldest sibling, so I feel like I have watched them both grow up and it is incredible.

All the roads that I were familiar with were closed and people kept beeping. I did not know where I was or how to get home. I had already planed to spend the afternoon doing homework but Being stuck in traffic wasted my time to do homework. As one guy was frantically beeping at me to move even though I couldn't I freaked out and started crying. I didn't know why he was beeping and cursing me out when we were in bumper to bumper traffic. So  was worried he'd start hitting my car or banging on my window out of anger. I was worried that I'd make a wrong turn and get lost even more. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9.132,171.198,172.962,105,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Disagree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Disagree,Agree,Agree,Disagree,Disagree,Agree,Agree,Agree Strongly,4.216,49.853,53.51,12,"Highly certain can do

I mean who would want a mess up, right? So, the order was meant to be a build-up piece in which we went from slow to fast pace with different styles of dance within the dance community. We had contemporary, jazz, hip hop, african, sexy, etc. and through it all we made a great piece. When I dance, I tend to zone out and feel the music. Depending on the type/style of dance, I add my own flavor and spice into it. Dance isn't just about you knowing the moves and getting them right, but about you really feeling the vibe and giving your all out whether you mess up or not. Everyone is not perfect and we all make our mistakes, but in the end it still all comes together and we do great not only individually but also as a team itself.

There was about thirty seconds left and the possesion before the game winner, i had turned the ball over, because i was basically scared of being on the ""big stage"" for the first time. And during that turnover the fans were yelling and my coach with pissed off that i had made a mistake, so now im completely scared and uncomfortable for the next two possessions. There was ten seconds left and we had drawled up a play to get the winning bucket, but of course i didn't follow the game plan. Instead, once my teammate passed me the ball, I believed in my shot making abilities and shot the basketball from the 3. Bang, it went it and the next thing i know everyone is on top of me. After the game, my coach pulled me aside and told me that he noticed i didn't run the play but was proud of me for believeing in myself even after the turnovers. I had the feeling that i was on top of the world, but at the same time humble for having that experience and learning from it.",3.708,60.574,61.884,21,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree Strongly,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Disagree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,41.792,51.991,53.201,7,9,8,9,9,8,9,9.059,17.113,18.049,4,moderately agree5,moderately agree5,moderately agree5,strongly agree6,Camren Rice,37.193,44.402,45.922,3,slightly agree,slightly agree,slightly agree,9.166,14.839,16.169,2,3,3,11.345,12.542,13.59,2,"very concerned

I was worryless, carefree, and I had all my hopes and dreams going for me. I remember going to Disney,as our class trip, and I remember feeling worried about wearing a two piece bathing suit because I had a little tummy. I got over it and went outside in my two piece, in front of all my fellow classmates,and no one judged me. Everything went well and I swam without a worry in the world about how I looked.
